# Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a powerful framework for building Java applications, focusing on convention over configuration and providing a seamless development experience. This README file aims to introduce the main features and modules of Spring Boot.

## Features

1. **Auto-configuration**: Spring Boot automatically configures various components based on the classpath, reducing the need for manual configuration. It leverages sensible defaults and makes it easy to override them when needed.

2. **Embedded Server**: Spring Boot includes an embedded server (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) so that you can run your application as a standalone JAR file. No external server installation is required.

3. **Starters**: Starters are a set of dependency descriptors that simplify the inclusion of specific Spring modules and their dependencies. By adding starters to your project, you get a curated set of dependencies for building specific types of applications (e.g., web applications, data access, messaging).

4. **Actuator**: Spring Boot Actuator provides various endpoints and metrics to monitor and manage your application in production. It offers health checks, metrics, logging, thread dumps, and more.

5. **Spring Boot CLI**: The Spring Boot Command-Line Interface (CLI) allows you to quickly prototype and develop Spring applications using Groovy scripts. It offers a fast way to develop Spring Boot applications without setting up a complete project structure.

6. **Spring Data**: Spring Boot provides excellent integration with Spring Data, which simplifies working with databases and allows you to build robust data access layers using a unified and consistent API.

7. **Spring Security**: Spring Boot offers seamless integration with Spring Security, enabling you to secure your applications easily. It provides authentication, authorization, and protection against common security vulnerabilities.

## Modules

Spring Boot is composed of several modules, each focusing on different aspects of application development:

1. **spring-boot-starter**: The core module that provides essential features to set up a Spring Boot application. It includes auto-configuration, embedded server support, and the ability to start standalone applications.

2. **spring-boot-starter-web**: Provides support for building web applications using Spring MVC. It includes embedded server support, the necessary dependencies for handling HTTP requests, and Spring WebFlux for reactive web programming.

3. **spring-boot-starter-data-jpa**: Offers integration with Spring Data JPA, allowing you to build repositories and work with databases using the Java Persistence API (JPA).

4. **spring-boot-starter-test**: Contains dependencies and utilities for testing Spring Boot applications, including JUnit, Mockito, and Spring Test.

5. **spring-boot-starter-actuator**: Provides the Actuator module, offering endpoints for monitoring and managing your application in production.

6. **spring-boot-starter-security**: Enables integration with Spring Security, allowing you to secure your applications easily.

7. **spring-boot-starter-amqp**: Supports messaging with RabbitMQ.

8. **spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb**: Offers integration with MongoDB, allowing you to work with MongoDB databases using Spring Data MongoDB.

9. **spring-boot-starter-data-rest**: Provides RESTful APIs for Spring Data repositories.

10. **spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf**: Enables server-side rendering of HTML templates using the Thymeleaf templating engine.

11. **spring-boot-starter-validation**: Provides validation support using the Java Bean Validation API.

These are just a few examples of the many modules available in Spring Boot. Each module provides specific functionality and can be included in your project as needed.
